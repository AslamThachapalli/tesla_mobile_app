# tesla_mobile_app

Animation App.\
An Animated UI for tesla mobile app

In this 'master' branch the animation is achieved using the raw flutter way.\
But this lacks readability and maintainability of the code. In order to make code more readable and maintainable **simple_animations** package can be used.\
In the 'simple' branch code is written in this way. The code is simplified, made more readable and maintainable. **The length of the code is also reduced by 26 lines**.\
**Switch to 'simple' branch to take a look at the code.**
